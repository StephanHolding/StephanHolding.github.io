					<h3 class="drop-shadow">The project itself</h3>
					<p><a href="https://www.ijslander.com/">IJslander</a> is a Dutch company which makes equipment for playgrounds. They asked my
						team and me to create a VR application to show off their equipment.</p>
					<p>All playground equipment is property of IJslander B.V.</p>

					<h3 class="drop-shadow">My contribution to the project</h3>
					<p>The following points are the systems that I've created while working on this project.
						A more in-depth explanation is written further below.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Object placing system</li>
						<li>Object information system</li>
						<li>Catalogue system</li>
						<li>Coloring system</li>
						<li>Serialization system</li>
						<li>Localization system</li>
					</ol>

					<h4>Object placing system</h4>
					<p> Every object of the playground equipment has a fall zone. This fall zone has to be
						entirely on the playground and cannot intersect with other objects or their fall
						zones.</p>
					<p> I used Unity primitves with a trigger collider as the fall zones. I placed an empty
						GameObject at every corner of the fall zone.
						All those objects shoot a raycast down. And only when all the raycasts hit the
						playground, the object will be fully on the field. And so the first boolean will be
						set to true.</p>
					<p> The aforementioned trigger collider is used to detect if an object or its fall zone
						is intersecting ours. If that is not the case, the second boolean will be set to
						true.
						If both booleans are true, then the object can be placed and the fall zone will turn
						from red to green.</p>

					<h4>Object information system</h4>
					<p> Every object needs to have a component containing information about that object. For
						example: its name, product code, dimensions or weight.</p>
					<p> This is a small script containing all variables with information about the object in
						question. This information is placed on the Catalogue's User Interface to help
						choose which object to place on your playground.</P>
					<div class="image main"><img src="images/SCcatalogue1.jpg" alt="" /></div>


					<h4>Catalogue system</h4>
					<p> Boiled down to the basics, the Catalogue is a big list of prefabs divided into a
						couple of subgroups.
						It accesses the Object Information component on the prefab and displays this
						information on the UI. There's also a thumbnail shown of the prefab you are
						currently looking at.
						When you press this thumbnail, the 3D model will appear and you can place it using
						the Object Placing system.</p>
					<div class="image main"><img src="images/SCcatalogue2.jpg" alt="" /></div>

					<h4>Coloring system</h4>
					<p>Some objects have pieces of their mesh that can be colored. When the object is
						instantiated, it gets an instance of the prefab's original material. So only that
						object's color changes, and not the prefab itself.</p>
					<p>There is only a limited amount of colors that IJslander can put on their equipment.
						These colors are stored on a ScriptableObject, which is more efficient than manually
						setting the color options on every object.</P>
					<div class="image main"><img src="images/GIFcolor1.gif" alt="" /></div>

					<h4>Serialization system</h4>
					<p> On every playground (there are three: 10x10, 20x20 and 30x30) there is an option to
						save the layout you've made.</p>
					<p> The serializable data for an object is held by a script named
						'SerializableObjectData'. When the save button is pressed, an instance of this
						script is created for every placed object. This contains the object's position,
						rotation the color of its materials.
						All these instances are then placed into an array and serialized by the DataManager
						using a binary formatter.
						The files are saved in their own folder in Unity's persistent datapath under a name
						of your own choosing.</p>
					<div class="image main"><img src="images/GIFserialization1.gif" alt="" /></div>

					<h4>Localization system</h4>
					<p> IJslander has international exhibitions and so they wanted a system to change the
						language of the application. I did this by giving every translatable text a script
						with a key. Then I serialized it to a JSON file. I chose JSON because it has to be
						readable to translate it.
						So this file contains a key and a value for every piece of text that has to be
						translated. When the application starts the appropriate language file is loaded into
						a Dictionary. Now when a piece of text needs translation, it can search its key in
						the Dictionary and use the matching value.</p>
