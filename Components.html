										<h3>Platform settings</h3>
										<p> This is a scriptable object that I made to more easily switch between platforms when creating VR games of applications. Before I made this script, I had to manually replace the player in all scenes every time I switched build platform.
											Now there is a central point that other scripts (like a player spawner) can access if they want to know what platform is currently used.
											Additionally, Unity's scripting define symbols are also changed according to the platform that's been chosen on the scriptable object. This way you can let certain code compile (or not) depending on which platform you have chosen.</p>

										<p> Example: Let's say you've made a player that can be used with SteamVR and OculusVR, but in your current project you only want to use SteamVR. Previously, not including OculusVR in your project would result in compile errors, as your code would search for OculusVR and find nothing.
											Now, with the help of scripting define symbols, you can make sure only the code that you want to use for your current project and platform is compiled.</p>

										<h3>ShowByEnum & ShowByBool Attribute</h3>
										<p> Before I made this attribute, I used to come accross a problem where i wanted to hide a variable in the inspector depending on the value of an enum or a boolean. <br>
											For Example: an OnTriggerEnter script that can either check for a tag, or a layer. In the inspector this would be an enum (for selecting which value to check), a string (for the tag check) and an int (for the layer check.)
											That's three variables in the inspector, even though only two are used at any given time. So to make these kinds of scripts easier to read and use, I created the ShowByEnum attribute.</p>
											
										<p> The attribute has two parameters: an int, or int array and a string. The first parameter represents the value or values that the enum can be  if you want the property (variable this attribute is used on) to be drawn. 
											The second parameter is the name of the enum instance in your class. This way, the editor script can find and access that enum and check its value in realtime.</p>
