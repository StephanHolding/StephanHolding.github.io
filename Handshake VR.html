										<h3>The concept</h3>
										<p> This is another VR project that I worked on when I had my internship with VRROOM Ultimate VR Experiences in Groningen.
											This project was given to us by TenneT, a dutch energy company. They wanted a VR application to show off the launch of the new COBRAcable. COBRAcable is around 325 kilometers long and connects the high voltage grids of Denmark and the Netherlands.
											The concept itself is not very complicated, but there was multiplayer involved. Which I programmed with the help of the Photon plugin for Unity.</p>
										
										<p>In the first stage of the application, the representatives of both countries can see each other's avatars on an in-game screen. After they had both talked to each other and done their intros, they both went through a wormhole and to the sea under which the COBRAcable is installed.
											After going down through the sea with a lift, both players arive in a small cavern where the COBRAcable is visible. They can now see each other's avatar in front of them, and when they're ready, give each other a handshake, marking the official launch of the COBRAcable.</p>

										<br />

										<h3>Multiplayer</h3>
										<p>As said in the concept section, this project needed to have multiplayer functionality which I programmed with the help of PUN (Photon Unity Networking.) Most functionality in the application would be in the form of events that would occur when both players performed an action.
											For example, if both players are done with a part (like the introduction) the can place their hand on a handscanner. A message is sent to the masterclient, and if the masterclient has recieved as many messages as there are players in the session (in this case always 2) the event will be started.</p>
										<p>The representatives of the companies had both never played VR before, and for some people it can be quite shocking, so I built in an extra input (first in the form of the space key, later a remote like the ones used for a projector) so that if the players would not be able to continue, the application would not come to a stop. </p>
